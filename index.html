                <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Brian Warner. I am 30 years old originally from Simi Valley, CA. I now live
                    in Capo Beach with my girlfriend. I work at an accounting firm as well as a drug and alcohol treatment
                    center called A Better Life. This is the first homework assignment in the coding bootcamp. It was pretty
                    hard. At some points I wanted to throw my computer through the window.
                </p>
                <p> I like long walks on the beach playing video games and training jiu-jitsu. I also like to play hockey when
                    I have some extra time and can get there. I have been playing hockey for over 20 years and it's probably
                    my favorite thing to do and watch. Other sports are insignificant compared to hockey
                </p>
                <p>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would
                    tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he
                    could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark
                    side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway
                    to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid
                    of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
                    everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death,
                    but not himself.
                </p>
